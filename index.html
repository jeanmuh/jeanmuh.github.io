                          This project involves creating and deploying a professional resume website using GitHub Pages, where the resume is presented as a webpage.
                          GitHub Pages allows hosting static websites directly from a GitHub repository, making it an easy, free, and convenient way to showcase your resume or portfolio. Some of the technologies used include: HTML/CSS, Git/GitHub and GitHub Pages. My role in the project was a Frontend Developer to design and implement the structure, layout, and styling of the resume webpage using HTML and CSS. Also I Created the GitHub repository, configured the Pages settings, and deployed the resume as a static website. Finally, I Managed the codebase using Git to track changes, collaborate, and maintain the project.
